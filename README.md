# Image Processing Network Project

This project focuses on building a network-based image processing system that utilizes an external Python API and the OpenCV library to perform various image processing operations, including gray scaling and face detection. The system is implemented in Java.

## Features

- **Image Processing Operations**: The system integrates with an external Python API to perform image processing tasks, such as gray scaling and face detection. These operations enhance the capabilities of the application and provide valuable functionalities for image manipulation.

- **OpenCV Integration**: The project leverages the OpenCV library to process images and detect faces within the images. The integration with OpenCV enhances the accuracy and efficiency of the face detection functionality.

## Installation

To run the image processing network project, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that Java Development Kit (JDK) is installed on your system. If not, download and install the latest JDK from the official Oracle website.

2. Clone the project repository from GitHub:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/image-processing-network-project.git
   ```

3. Install the necessary Java dependencies.

4. Install the required Python dependencies for the external API. Detailed instructions for setting up the Python API can be found in the `api/README.md` file.

## Usage

1. Start the external Python API by following the instructions provided in the `api/README.md` file.

2. Run the Java program `ImageProcessingApp.java` to launch the image processing network application.

3. Follow the on-screen instructions to input the image file path and select the desired image processing operation (e.g., gray scaling or face detection).

4. The application will send the image to the external Python API for processing and display the processed result.
